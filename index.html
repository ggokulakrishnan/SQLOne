      <p>SQLOne (the Acharya !!!)</p>

<p>(My learning with SQL Server ... )</p>

<p>The project contains series of SQL scripts (targeted for MS SQL Server engine) from Basics to Advanced level for the developer community</p>

<p>The SQL scripts were created for my personal learning, all the information in the Scripts are gathered from web (various blogs, sites, communities, usergroups, etc..). Hence sharing them back to the developer community as it will be useful for the developers who are planning to start their carrier in MS SQL Server</p>

<p>Scripts will be constantly updates with new features and releases from MS SQL Server ...</p>

<p>So lets get started and start learning MS SQL Server today :)</p>

<p>Happy Learning ...</p>

<p>All your feedback / suggestions are welcome and will be considered on priority. Kindly write to me at: <a href="mailto:gokul.g@hotmail.com">gokul.g@hotmail.com</a></p>

<p>Note: Kindly use all these scripts in your test / development box only (The developer needs to use these scripts under his own risk)</p>
